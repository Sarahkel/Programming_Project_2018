    "In this Jupyter workbook I will walk through the process of synthesising a dataset using Python. The dataset will aim to simulate a real-world phenomenon across at least 100 different datapoints and at least 4 different variables. The challenge lies not only in understanding how to use Python and available packages to synthesise a dataset but also in gaining a deep understanding of the data this project aims to simulate.\n",

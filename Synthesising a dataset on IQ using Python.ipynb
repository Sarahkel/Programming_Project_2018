    "In this Jupyter workbook I will walk through the process of synthesising a dataset using Python. The dataset will aim to simulate a real-world phenomenon across at least 100 different datapoints and at least 4 different variables. The challenge lies not only in understanding how to use Python and available packages to synthesise a dataset but also in gaining a deep understanding of the data this project aims to simulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables for which the datapoints are created will be investigated to determine their type and likely distributions and also how they relate to one-another to ensure a product that is as close to the real-life phenomenon as possible.\n",

    "## General Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "One might ask: Why synthesise a dataset if I can simply go online to find data? A fairly straight-forward way to simulate a dataset could be to take an existing dataset, analyse its statistics and use the data on values, minimum, maximum, average, median, correlations and regressions to feed into a function that will either create the exact same dataset or randomise the dataset along the same base statistics. In fact, there are a number of Website and Apps which make this process easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, researching different approaches on how to synthesise data brings forward many sources that are related to machine learning, deep learning and testing calculations as well as applications. Synthesised data can be used to test or develop applications in situations where collection of real data would delay development because of the time and resources it would require. (1) It is not difficult to imagine such a situation in a corporate environment. Furthermore, it can serve as a basis to train a machine learning algorithm on. (1, wikipedia)\n",
    "\n",
    "[tbc]\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this project will attempt to model a dataset not recreating a specific already existing dataset but after assumptions and insights that were derived from researching the real-life-phenomenon.\n",

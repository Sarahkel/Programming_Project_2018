# Programming_Project_2018
Project 2018 for Programming for Data Analysis

Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. Detail research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook. Synthesise at east one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

# How to run the notebook
Please find the project [here](https://github.com/Sarahkel/Programming_Project_2018-Synthesising-an-IQ-dataset-with-Python/blob/master/Synthesising%20a%20dataset%20on%20IQ%20using%20Python.ipynb) under "Synthesising a dataset on IQ using Python.ipynb" and run from top to bottom. As all the package imports are done in the first cell of code it is crucial to have this run. Also, it is possible that cells build on variables defined in previous code cells.

References can be found at the end of each section and are marked (n).

For any question, please feel free to contact me.
